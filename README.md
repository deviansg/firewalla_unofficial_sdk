# Unofficial Firewalla SDK

A simple Python-based SDK for Firewalla. All methods are based on the Firewalla API documentation found here: https://docs.firewalla.net/

The above assumes that you are using Firewalla's MSP service as you will need it to use the API.

All functionality is within one file: firewalla.py making it pretty simple to use.

## Import Note

This project is very much a work-in-progress. You can safely assume that this is not officially supported by Firewalla in any way, so if the API changes, it may break functionality within this package.

If you happen to be using this and it stops working feel free to open an issue or pull request!

## Examples:

You can find examples in the `examples` folder.
